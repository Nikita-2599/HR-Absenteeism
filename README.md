### Outcome from the project

This project can help us to easily track the daily absenteeism data of employees within an organisation. As per the analysis, it is observed that there is high abseetism rate on every Saturday and Monday. This is because of long weekend. 
So, necessary actions are taken by the HR department to reduce the absenteeism rate on weekends to ensure that there is no production loss.
